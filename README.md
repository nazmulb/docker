# Docker

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. The use of containers to deploy applications is called containerization.

Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:

- **Flexible:** Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- **Lightweight:** Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
- **Interchangeable:** You can deploy updates and upgrades on-the-fly.
- **Portable:** You can build locally, deploy to the cloud, and run anywhere.
- **Scalable:** You can increase and automatically distribute container replicas.
- **Stackable:** You can stack services vertically and on-the-fly.
